## Architecture & Branches
This repository demonstrates different Android architecture approaches. Each branch contains the **same app functionality** but uses different tech stacks and patterns:

1. **MVP** (branch: `master`)
   - **Java 17**
   - Plain MVP architecture (no Clean Architecture)
   - **Dagger2** for dependency injection
   - **RxJava** for reactive programming
   - **Tests**: JUnit, Mockito, Robolectric

2. **MVP-MVI** (branch: `mvp-mvi`)
   - **Java 17**
   - Clean Architecture + MVP + MVI pattern
   - **Hilt** for dependency injection
   - **RxJava** for reactive programming
   - **Tests**: JUnit, Mockito, Robolectric

---

## Technologies Used
- **Room** (local database storage)  
- **ML Kit** for QR scanner functionality (scan contact QR codes)  
- **JUnit** for unit testing  
- **Mockito** for mocking dependencies  
- **Robolectric** for Android-specific unit tests  
- **Gradle** build system
